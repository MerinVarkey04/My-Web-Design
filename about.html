                <p class="intro">Hello! I’m Merin Varkey, a cheerful BCA student at MACFAST College in Tiruvalla. I love exploring my passions and sharing them with others.</p>
                
                <p class="details">Singing brings me joy and allows me to express myself creatively. I also enjoy reading, whether it’s diving into captivating stories or exploring new ideas. Coding is another passion of mine; I find it exciting to solve problems and create innovative solutions.

                    I believe that a positive attitude can make a difference, and I strive to bring that cheerfulness into everything I do. Welcome to my website, where I share my interests and projects. I’m glad you’re here!</p>
